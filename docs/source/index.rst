Binder is an open source digital repository designed to meet the needs and
complex digital preservation requirements of museum collections. Binder was
created by Artefactual Systems and the Museum of Modern Art.

Binder aims to facilitate digital collections care, management, and
preservation for time-based media and born-digital artworks and is built
from integrating functionality of the Archivematica and AtoM projects.

A presentation on Binder's functionality, given at AMIA 2014, can be viewd
online_ (note that Binder was initially called the DRMC).
